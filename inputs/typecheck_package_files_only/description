Whether to only typecheck `package.dhall` files (as opposed to `*.dhall`.

The thought here is that checking `package.dhall` is likely to transitively
check all other `*.dhall`, so it should be sufficient while avoiding lots of
duplicated work.

However, this is certainly not always the case, so consider that when setting
this input to `true`.''
